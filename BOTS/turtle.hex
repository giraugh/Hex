this is like a little turtle you
can give instructions to get him
to move around.
You can pretty much get him to do
whatever but here he is doing a
spiral. this program is a little slow though

NOTE:
valid() means that its only run once per turn
but also means that it has got no error checking.
i.e its validated by the game & not the error checker.
so if you want to change anything in the MOVE or CHANGE STATE
sections, i recommend you change valid() to !valid() and change
it back once your done
